Write a function all_targets_hit_upgrade that takes the results of shots at each target.

The results are a list, where each element is a list of boolean values corresponding to the results of
shots at one of the targets. If the value is True, it means that the target was hit by that shot; if it's False, it means it was not.
Therefore, if there is at least one True value in the list, the target was hit; if all values are False, it was not.

The function all_targets_hit_upgrade returns True if all targets were hit.

The function should contain only the return statement. Use list comprehension.
Additionally, it is very convenient to use the functions any and all to solve this problem.
